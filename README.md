Community Garden Starter -- proof of concept

A hub that allows local communities to organize community gardens with acces
that is provided by the app to local produce and other resources for getting started.

Community gardens are one of the most impactful events that a group can do.

This would serve as a cloud-based social media platform that is built specifically for the creation of community gardens,
equipped with directions to tap into local resources as well as connect with other gardens from other communities.
